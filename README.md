# Awesense-Project
This repository contains the solution to the convex optimization problem presented by Awesense. 

The problem is based on balancing the workloads of the producing electrical transformers required by the consumers, taking into account the distance involved as the reconnection cost.

My contribution was to create the mathematical model to be optimized, the constraints, and the objective function. I also programmed the model so that it could be solved using algorithms available in the Python CVXPY package.
